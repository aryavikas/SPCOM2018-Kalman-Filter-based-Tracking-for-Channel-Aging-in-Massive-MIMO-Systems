# SPCOM2018-Kalman-Filter-based-Tracking-for-Channel-Aging-in-Massive-MIMO-Systems
Abstract
â€”We  consider  the  problem  of  channel  aging  in  mas-
sive  multi-user  multiple-input-multiple-output  (MIMO)  wireless
systems  using  the  Kalman  filters  to  predict/estimate  an  aging
channel in a massive MIMO set-up without knowledge of channel
correlation  statistics.  Although  Wiener  filtering  can  be  used  to
estimate  the  channel  state  information  to  construct  accurate
precoders  and  decoders,  their  use  is  limited  in  the  case  where
regular  adaptation  to  channel  changes  is  needed.  In  addition,
since different users exhibit different mobility conditions, use of
an  adaptive  Kalman  filter  is  advantageous  when  compared  to
conventional  estimation  approaches.  We  build  a  general  model
that allows a wide range of user mobilities in each cell. Simula-
tions  using  the  model  reveal  that  the  Kalman  filter  is  effective
in  predicting  channel  coefficients  to  build  an  effective  precoder.
In addition, we perform both uplink and downlink analysis and
show  that  with  poorer  channel  tracking,  the  achievable  rates  in
massive MIMO diminish unless more accurate channel estimates
are  present.
